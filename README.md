# dmMediaConverter - v2.4.1 by Dalacu Marius

A complex application that allows you to change video and audio settings for multimedia files, split clips or merge several input items
dmMediaConverter is a reliable application that allows you to manipulate multimedia files, by modifying the video and audio streams separately. The application supports handling several files at once and allows you to customize the changes for each one of them individually.

Selecting source files
dmMediaConverter is designed as a front end of FFmpeg and it is based on some of its key functions. Some of the most important features offered by dmMediaConverter are the batch file processing and the individual media streams manipulation. Once you load the input files, you can select the type of task you wish to perform: conversion, merger, split or bulk actions.

The application supports both audio and video files, which it displays in the dedicated tables, along with the duration, streams count, bitrate, size and duration. The informational table below offers detailed information on each of the streams contained in the file. By default, they are copied as the original, but you may easily customize each of them individually.

Encoding settings and bulk functions
You may change the audio/video codec, sample rate, bitrate, channels, frame rate and other specific encoding settings, which change in accordance to the selected file type. You may enter metadata, add creation time or modify each frame by cropping and rotating it. The split function allows you to separate one or more segments from the selected file.

Moreover, you can use the Bulk function in order to extract the audio stream from a video or from a multitude of clips. You may easily manage the video or audio streams, as well as the subtitles if available.

Save action profiles
Once you start a certain process, you may watch its progress in the Job Queue tab, which allows you to stop or start the task at any time. Moreover, the activity log is updated in real time and can be viewed in the Output tab. Additionally, you may save a particular set of settings as a profile and load it when convenient.
